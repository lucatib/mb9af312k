Function description:
===============================================================================================
Demo Watch Counter function with polling for interrupt occurrence.

===============================================================================================
Environment
===============================================================================================
Test Board:
---------------------
MCU evaluation board

Assistance tool:
---------------------
Oscilloscope

Assistance software:
---------------------
None

===============================================================================================
Usage Procedure:
===============================================================================================
1) Rebuild and run the program.  
2) Watch the Terminal I/O window or UART debug interface (Debug viewer), and GPIO toggle wave can be observed at P61 synchronously.

===============================================================================================
Notice:
===============================================================================================
1) The printf content can be output to debug viewer In IAR with semi-hosting mode.
2) The printf content can be output to debug viewer In Keil MDK via SWO line. 
3) The printf content can also output to UART0 (SOT0_0).
   Make following steps to enable this method:
   - Set "PDL_PERIPHERAL_ENABLE_MFS0" and "PDL_UTILITY_ENABLE_UART_PRINTF" to PDL_ON in pdl.user.h
   - Call "Uart_Io_Init()" at the begin of main function 
4) For FM3 and FM4 products, All of 1), 2), 3) can be supported. However SWO pin is not available 
   in FM0+ product. So only 1), 3) can be suppoted for FM0+ products.
5) Before using printf function, enable the definition "DEBUG_PRINT" in pdl_user.h. When user
   Want to program the code into Flash and run the code standalone, disable the definition 
   "DEBUG_PRINT" in pdl_user.h.
